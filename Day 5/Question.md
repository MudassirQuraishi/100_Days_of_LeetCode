# 1518. Water Bottles

You have a certain number of water bottles, and you can exchange empty bottles for filled ones at a given exchange rate. The goal is to determine the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

## Problem Statement

Given the integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, where `numBottles` represents the initial number of water bottles and `numExchange` is the exchange rate for empty bottles to filled ones, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
```

**Output:**
```
13
```

**Explanation:**
You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
```

**Output:**
```
19
```

**Explanation:**
You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= numBottles <= 100
- 2 <= numExchange <= 100
