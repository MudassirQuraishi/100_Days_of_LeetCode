# 231. Power of Two

# Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, determine if it is a power of two. Return `true` if `n` is a power of two, and `false` otherwise.

An integer `n` is a power of two if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 2^x`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: `n = 1`
Output: `true`

Explanation: `2^0 = 1`, so `n` is a power of two.

**Example 2:**

Input: `n = 16`
Output: `true`

Explanation: `2^4 = 16`, so `n` is a power of two.

**Example 3:**

Input: `n = 3`
Output: `false`
