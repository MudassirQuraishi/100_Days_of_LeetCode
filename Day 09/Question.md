# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of sizes `m` and `n` respectively, find the median of the combined sorted array.

## Example

### Example 1:

Input: 
```
nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
```
Output: 
```
2.00000
```
Explanation: 
- Merged array = `[1,2,3]`
- Median is `2.0`.

### Example 2:

Input: 
```
nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
```
Output: 
```
2.50000
```
Explanation: 
- Merged array = `[1,2,3,4]`
- Median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

## Constraints:

- `nums1.length == m`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m <= 1000`
- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m + n <= 2000`
- `-10^6 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6`
