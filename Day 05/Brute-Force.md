# Intuition
The problem seems to be about exchanging empty bottles for filled ones. The goal is to find the maximum number of filled bottles that can be obtained given a certain number of initially filled bottles and a specific exchange rate.

# Approach
The code uses a loop to simulate the process of exchanging empty bottles for filled ones. It iterates as long as there are enough empty bottles to make an exchange according to the specified exchange rate. In each iteration, it calculates the number of bottles obtained through the exchange and updates the remaining empty bottles. The maximum number of bottles is also updated accordingly.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(\log_{\text{numExchange}}(\text{numBottles}))$$ - The loop iterates until the number of bottles is less than the exchange rate. The number of iterations is determined by the logarithm base `numExchange` of `numBottles`.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$ - The algorithm uses a constant amount of space, as it only requires a few variables regardless of the input.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int maxBottles = numBottles;
        while (numBottles / numExchange != 0) {
            int exchange = numBottles / numExchange;
            int left  = numBottles % numExchange;
            maxBottles = maxBottles + exchange;
            numBottles = exchange + left;
        }
        return maxBottles;
    }
}
```
