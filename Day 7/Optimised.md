This code seems to be adding an integer `k` to an array-form integer `num` by simulating addition similar to how one would add numbers manually, digit by digit, considering carry values.

# Intuition

The code seems to start from the least significant digit of `num`, adds `k` to it while considering carry values, and then adds any remaining digits of `k` to the result.

# Approach

1. The code iterates through `num` from the end (least significant digit) to the beginning.
2. It adds the corresponding digit of `k` to the current digit of `num`, updating `k` and the current digit of `num` accordingly, considering the carry.
3. If there are remaining digits in `k` after adding to `num`, it appends those remaining digits to the front of the result list.
4. Finally, it converts the updated `num` array into a list and returns it as the result.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:
  - The code iterates through the `num` array once, performing constant-time operations in each iteration. The subsequent addition of remaining digits of `k` also takes linear time proportional to the number of digits in `k`. Thus, the time complexity is **O(max(N, log K))**, where `N` is the number of digits in `num` and `K` is the value of `k`.
- Space complexity:
  - The space complexity is **O(max(N, log K))** as it creates a list to store the result, which could be as large as the sum of the lengths of `num` and `k`.

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> addToArrayForm(int[] num, int k) {
        for(int i = num.length - 1; i>=0; i--) {
            int sum = num[i] + k;
            if(k==0) {
                break;
            } else {
                k = sum/10;
                num[i] = sum%10;
            }
        }
        List<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while(k>0) {
            ans.add(0,k%10);
            k = k/10;
        }
        for(int n : num) {
            ans.add(n);
        }
        return ans;
}
}
```
