# 268. Missing Number in Range

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, find the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

## Examples

### Example 1

Input:

```java
int[] nums = {3, 0, 1};
```

Output:

```java
2
```

Explanation:

-   `n = 3` since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,3]`.
-   `2` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

### Example 2

Input:

```java
int[] nums = {0, 1};
```

Output:

```java
2
```

Explanation:

-   `n = 2` since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,2]`.
-   `2` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.

### Example 3

Input:

```java
int[] nums = {9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1};
```

Output:

```java
8
```

Explanation:

-   `n = 9` since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range `[0,9]`.
-   `8` is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in `nums`.
