# 100 Days of LeetCode Solutions

## Challenge Description

Welcome to my "100 Days of LeetCode Solutions" challenge. Over the next 100 days, I will be tackling a variety of random LeetCode problems. For each problem, I will provide both a brute-force solution and an optimized solution in Java. This challenge is designed to help me improve my problem-solving skills and share my journey with the community.

## Goals

1. Solve one LeetCode problem each day.
2. Provide both brute-force and optimized solutions.
3. Document and explain my thought process in the solutions.
4. Share my solutions on [Platform Name] and LinkedIn to connect with other developers.

## Getting Started

1. Each day, I will randomly select a LeetCode problem to solve.
2. I will code both a brute-force solution and an optimized solution in Java.
3. I will document and comment on my code to explain my thought process.
4. I will post my solutions on [Platform Name] and share them on my LinkedIn profile.

## Directory Structure

- Solutions will be organized in separate directories for each day, e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, and so on.
- Inside each day's directory, I will include Java files for the brute-force and optimized solutions.

## Let's Connect

I'd love to connect with other developers and enthusiasts who are also passionate about problem-solving and coding. Please feel free to connect with me on:

- GitHub: [https://github.com/MudassirQuraishi]

## Acknowledgments

This challenge is inspired by the desire to improve my coding skills and share knowledge with others. Thanks to the LeetCode community for providing a wealth of interesting problems to solve.
