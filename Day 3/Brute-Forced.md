# Intuition:

The intuition behind this code is to calculate the Fibonacci numbers using a recursive approach. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. So, the code recursively computes the Fibonacci number for `n` by adding the Fibonacci numbers for `n-1` and `n-2`.

# Approach:

1. The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1. In this case, the code returns `n` because the Fibonacci numbers for 0 and 1 are 0 and 1, respectively.

2. For `n` greater than 1, the code recursively calls the `fib` function for `n-1` and `n-2`, and then adds the results. This is how the code generates Fibonacci numbers recursively.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: O(2^n) - The time complexity of this code is exponential because it recalculates the Fibonacci numbers for smaller values repeatedly, leading to a lot of redundant calculations. This approach is highly inefficient for larger values of `n`.
- Space complexity: O(n) - The space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursive call stack, which is O(n) in this case because the code can have at most `n` recursive calls on the stack.

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
         if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        } else {
            return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
        }
    }
}
```

- While this code provides a straightforward recursive solution to calculate Fibonacci numbers, it's not efficient for larger values of `n` due to its exponential time complexity. Optimized approaches using iterative methods or memoization are better suited for large `n` values.
