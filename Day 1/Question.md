# 9. Palindrome Number

## Description

This program determines whether an integer is a palindrome or not. A palindrome number reads the same from left to right and from right to left.

## Example

- **Input**: `121`

  - **Output**: `true`
  - **Explanation**: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

- **Input**: `-121`

  - **Output**: `false`
  - **Explanation**: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

- **Input**: `10`
  - **Output**: `false`
  - **Explanation**: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
