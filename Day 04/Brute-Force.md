# Intuition
The code appears to implement a function to calculate the nth Tribonacci number. Tribonacci is a series similar to Fibonacci, but each term is the sum of the three preceding terms.

# Approach
The code uses a loop to calculate the Tribonacci numbers iteratively. It initializes variables t0, t1, and t2 to the first three Tribonacci numbers and then iterates from 3 to n, updating the variables in each iteration. The result is stored in the variable t3, which is returned at the end.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$ - The loop runs n-2 times, where n is the input, so the time complexity is linear.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$ - The algorithm uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input, as it only requires a few variables to store intermediate results.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int tribonacci(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n < 3) return 1;
        int t0 = 0;
        int t1 = 1;
        int t2 = 1;
        int t3 = 0;
        int i = 3;
        while (i <= n) {
            t3 = t0 + t1 + t2;
            t0 = t1;
            t1 = t2;
            t2 = t3;
            i++;
        }
        return t3;
    }
}
```

This code should correctly calculate the nth Tribonacci number for the given input.
