# 1137. N-th Tribonacci Number

The Tribonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence defined as follows:

- T0 = 0
- T1 = 1
- T2 = 1
- Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0

## Problem Statement

Given an integer n, the task is to find the value of Tn in the Tribonacci sequence.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
n = 4
```
**Output:**
```
4
```
**Explanation:**
```
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
n = 25
```
**Output:**
```
1389537
```

## Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 37
- The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, i.e., answer <= 2^31
